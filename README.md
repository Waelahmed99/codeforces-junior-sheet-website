# Welcome to Smart-Sheet project!

### Overview
Welcome to Smart-Sheet open source project, this project is aiming to facilitate practicing problem solving using external sheets from online judge websites (mainly codeforces).
The idea behind this project is to connect sheets with online judge APIs instead of manually recording progress using Google Sheet or any other note-taking app.

This project was mainly designing to facilitate using [Mostafa Saad's](https://github.com/mostafa-saad) junior sheet on [Google sheet](https://goo.gl/unDETI), then the idea expanded to host all problem solving sheets on one place.
